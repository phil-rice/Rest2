# Javascript

Currently it is being generated but we need to 'manage it'. 
* Short term just aggregate and store
* Long term we need the 'correct javascript'for this request.
* We would like strategies that allow the javascript to be included (piecemeal) or sent with the data

# JSON

* We need to parse JSON for puts/posts
* We want a nice library instead of quick JSON

# Demo

* Make the same demo as for Scala rest
