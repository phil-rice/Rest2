# Javascript

Currently it is being generated but we need to 'manage it'. 
* Short term just aggregate and store
* Long term we need the 'correct javascript'for this request.
* We would like strategies that allow the javascript to be included (piecemeal) or sent with the data

# JSON

* We need to parse JSON for puts/posts
* We want a nice library instead of quick JSON
* We need to make the prototype story clean: perhaps we need to ask for a prototype?

#Lists
No idea what to do...
Reading is easy... but what about writing? What if they are links/embedded?


#Embedded/Link
Pretty cool, but let's do that when everything else is done... place holders are nice

#Links

The state based approach demoed in Trafficlights looks really simple to use and seriously cool

# Demo

* Make the same demo as for Scala rest

# Ideas
 
Don't forget we can use exactly the same idea for Cassandra/Doc model in SQL. We can store the javascript
in the database (indexed by hashcode)
