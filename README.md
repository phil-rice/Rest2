# This is an exercise is refactoring

[The refactoring is described here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTw7fF2UlQ7HW8o_aehLIYbbIjaZt1xSKqQUWv6jmomJNM68GkRhJ5gzCY-VE1tkAVFveLWStR6D_nj/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

The original code was part of a spring boot project. 

This code is just a 'scaffolding' that allows us to experiment with the code.
